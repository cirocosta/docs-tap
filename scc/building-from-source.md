# Building from source

Regardless of the Out of the Box Supply Chain Package installed, when it comes
to providing source code for the Workload, that can either come from a
developer's machine (directory in the filesystem) or a Git repository.

```
Supply Chain
   
  -- fetch source                 * either from Git or local directory
    -- test 
      -- build 
        -- scan 
          -- apply-conventions 
            -- push config
```

Below we'll dive into details about both approaches.

> **Note:** If you don't want to have the application built from scratch using
> the supply chain, but instead provide a pre-built container image, check out
> [Pre-built image](pre-built-image.md).


## Git source

To provide source code from a Git repository to the supply chains,
`workload.spec.source.git` should be filled.

With the `tanzu` CLI, one can do so via the following flags:

- `--git-branch`: branch within the git repo to checkout
- `--git-commit`: commit SHA within the git repo to checkout
- `--git-repo`: git url to remote source code
- `--git-tag`: tag within the git repo to checkout

For instance, having installed `ootb-supply-chain-basic`, we could create a
`Workload` whose source code comes from the `main` branch of the
`github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app` git repository issuing the
following command:

```bash
tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
  --app tanzu-java-web-app \
  --type web \
  --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app \
  --git-branch main
```
```console
Create workload:
      1 + |---
      2 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
      3 + |kind: Workload
      4 + |metadata:
      5 + |  labels:
      6 + |    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: tanzu-java-web-app
      7 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web
      8 + |  name: tanzu-java-web-app
      9 + |  namespace: default
     10 + |spec:
     11 + |  source:
     12 + |    git:
     13 + |      ref:
     14 + |        branch: main
     15 + |      url: https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app
```

> **Note:** the Git repository URL must include the scheme (`http://`,
`https://`, or `ssh://`).


### Private git repository

To fetch source code from a repository that requires credentials, one must
provide those via a Kubernetes Secret object that is then referenced by the
`GitRepostiory` object created for that Workload (see [how it
works](#how-it-works) to know more about the underlying process of detecting
changes to the repository).

```scala
Workload/tanzu-java-web-app
└─GitRepository/tanzu-java-web-app  
                   └───────> secretRef: {name: GIT-SECRET-NAME}
                                                   |
                                      either a default from TAP installation or
                                           gitops_ssh_secret Workload parameter
```

Platform operators that installed the Out of the Box Supply Chain packages
using TAP profiles can customize the default name of the secret (`git-ssh`) by
tweaking the corresponding `ootb_supply_chain*` property in the
`tap-values.yml` file:


```yaml
ootb_supply_chain_basic:
  gitops:
    ssh_secret: GIT-SECRET-NAME
```

For those that installed the `ootb-supply-chain-*` package individually via
`tanzu package install`, one can tweak the `ootb-supply-chain-*-values.yml` as
such:

```yaml
gitops:
  ssh_secret: GIT-SECRET-NAME
```

Ultimately, it's also possible to override the default secret name directly in
the Workload by leveraging the `gitops_ssh_secret` parameter, regardless of how
TAP has been installed. Using the Tanzu CLI, that can be done with the
`--param` flag. For instance:

```bash
tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
  --app tanzu-java-web-app \
  --type web \
  --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app \
  --git-branch main \
  --param gitops_ssh_secret=SECRET-NAME
```
```console
Create workload:
      1 + |---
      2 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
      3 + |kind: Workload
      4 + |metadata:
      5 + |  labels:
      6 + |    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: tanzu-java-web-app
      7 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web
      8 + |  name: tanzu-java-web-app
      9 + |  namespace: default
     10 + |spec:
     11 + |  params:
     12 + |  - name: gitops_ssh_secret	#! parameter that overrides the default
     13 + |    value: GIT-SECRET-NAME     #! secret name
     14 + |  source:
     15 + |    git:
     16 + |      ref:
     17 + |        branch: main
     18 + |      url: https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app
```

> **Note:** a secret reference will only be provided to GitRepository if
> `gitops_ssh_secret` has been set to a non-empty string in some fashion
> (either package property or workload parameter). If you need to force a
> GitRepository to not reference a secret, set the value to an empty string
> (`""`).

With the name of Kubernetes Secret defined, we can move on to the definition of
the Secret itself.


#### HTTP(S) Basic-auth / Token-based authentication

Despite both the Package value being called `gitops.ssh_secret` and Workload
parameter `gitops_ssh_secret`, it's possible to make use of HTTP(S) transports
just as well.

To do so, first make sure that the repository in the `Workload` spec makes use
of `http://` OR `https://` schemes in any URLs that relate to the repositories
(e.g., `https://github.com/my-org/my-repo` as opposed to
`github.com/my-org/my-repo` or `ssh://github.com:my-org/my-repo`).

Then, in the same namespace as the Workload, create a Kubernetes Secret object
of type `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` like so with the name matching the one
expected by the supply chain as explained in the section above:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: GIT-SECRET-NAME
  annotations:
    tekton.dev/git-0: GIT-SERVER        # ! required
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: GIT-USERNAME
  password: GIT-PASSWORD
```

With the Secret created with the name matching the one configured for
`gitops.ssh_secret`, attach it to the ServiceAccount used by the Workload. For
instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default
secrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
  - name: tap-registry
  - name: GIT-SECRET-NAME
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
  - name: tap-registry
```

To know more about the credentials and setting up the Kubernetes secret, check
out [Git Authentication's HTTP section](git-auth.md#http).


#### SSH auth

Aside from using HTTP(S) as a transport, it's also possible to make use of SSH.

First make sure that the repository URL in the Workload spec makes use of
`ssh://` as the scheme in the URL (e.g.,
`ssh://git@github.com:my-org/my-repo.git`).  

Then, create a Kubernetes Secret object of type `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth` like
so:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: GIT-SECRET-NAME
	annotations:
    tekton.dev/git-0: GIT-SERVER
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
stringData:
  ssh-privatekey: SSH-PRIVATE-KEY     # private key with push-permissions
  identity: SSH-PRIVATE-KEY           # private key with pull permissions
  identity.pub: SSH-PUBLIC-KEY        # public of the `identity` private key
  known_hosts: GIT-SERVER-PUBLIC-KEYS # git server public keys
```

With the Secret created with the name matching the one configured for
`gitops.ssh_secret`, attach it to the ServiceAccount used by the Workload. For
instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default
secrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
  - name: tap-registry
  - name: GIT-SECRET-NAME
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
  - name: tap-registry
```

To know more about how to generate the keys and set it up with the git server,
check out [Git Authentication's SSH section](git-auth.md#ssh).


### How it works

With the `workload.spec.source.git` filled, the supply chain takes care of
managing a child `GitRepository` object that keeps track of commits made to the
git repository stated in `workload.spec.source.git`.

For each revision found, `gitrepository.status.artifact` gets updated providing
information about an HTTP endpoint that the controller makes available for
other components to fetch the source code from within the cluster, as well as
the digest of the latest commit found:

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: tanzu-java-web-app
spec:
  gitImplementation: go-git
  ignore: '!.git'
  interval: 1m0s
  ref: {branch: main}
  timeout: 20s
  url: https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app
status:
  artifact:
    checksum: 375c2daee5fc8657c5c5b49711a8e94d400994d7
    lastUpdateTime: "2022-04-07T15:02:30Z"
    path: gitrepository/default/tanzu-java-web-app/d85df1fc.tar.gz
    revision: main/d85df1fc28c6b86ca54bd613f55991645d3b257c
    url: http://source-controller.flux-system.svc.cluster.local./gitrepository/default/tanzu-java-web-app/d85df1fc.tar.gz
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-04-07T15:02:30Z"
    message: 'Fetched revision: main/d85df1fc28c6b86ca54bd613f55991645d3b257c'
    reason: GitOperationSucceed
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  observedGeneration: 1
```

This way, with Cartographer passing the artifact URL and revision to further
components in the supply chain, those just need to consume the source code from
an internal URL where a tarball with the source code can be fetched, not having
to deal with any Git-specific details in multiple places.


### Workload parameters

There are a two parameters that can be passed via the Workload object's
`workload.spec.params` field to override the default behavior of the
GitRepository object created for keeping track of the changes to a repository:

- `gitImplementation`: name of the git implementation (one of `libgit2` or
  `go-git`) to be used for fetching the source code

- `gitops_ssh_secret`: name of the secret in the same namespace as the Workload
  where credentials to for fetching the repository can be found.

These can also be customized with defaults for the whole cluster via properties
for either `tap-values.yml` (when installing supply chains via TAP profiles),
or `ootb-supply-chain-*-values.yml` (when installing the OOTB packages
individually):

- `git_implementation` (same as `gitImplementation` as a Workload parameter)
- `gitops.ssh_secret` (same as `gitops_ssh_secret` Workload parameter)


## Local source

To provide source code from a local directory (e.g., a directory in the
developer's filesystem), the `tanzu` CLI provides two flags that allows one to
tell where the source code is at in the filesystem, and where it should be
pushed to as a container image:

- `--local-path`: path on the local file system to a directory of source code
  to build for the workload
- `--source-image`: destination image repository where source code is staged
  before being built

This way, regardless of whether the cluster the developer is targetting is
really local (a cluster in the developer's machine) or not, the source code
will be made available by using an image registry for that.

For instance, assuming a developer has source code under the current directory
(`.`) and access to a repository (`REGISTRY-REPOSITORY`) in a container image
registry (`REGISTRY-SERVER`), a Workload could be created like so:

```bash
tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
  --app tanzu-java-web-app \
  --type web \
  --local-path . \
  --source-image $REGISTRY/test
```
```console
Publish source in "." to "REGISTRY-SERVER/REGISTRY-REPOSITORY"? 
It may be visible to others who can pull images from that repository 

	Yes

Publishing source in "." to "REGISTRY-SERVER/REGISTRY-REPOSITORY"...
Published source

Create workload:
      1 + |---
      2 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
      3 + |kind: Workload
      4 + |metadata:
      5 + |  labels:
      6 + |    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: tanzu-java-web-app
      7 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web
      8 + |  name: tanzu-java-web-app
      9 + |  namespace: default
     10 + |spec:
     11 + |  source:
     12 + |    image: REGISTRY-SERVER/REGISTRY-REPOSITORY:latest@<digest>
```


### Authentication

Both the cluster and the developer's machine must be configured to properly
provide the credentials for accessing the image registry where the local source
code will be published to. 

#### Developer

As the `tanzu` CLI needs to push content (the source code) to the image
registry indicated via `--source-image`, it's important for the CLI to find the
credentials that allows it to do so, requiring the developer to configure their
machine accordingly.

To ensure credentials are available, use `docker` to make the necessary
credentials available for the Tanzu CLI to perform the image push:

```
docker login REGISTRY-SERVER -u REGISTRY-USERNAME -p REGISTRY-PASSWORD
```

#### Supply chain components

Aside from the developer's ability to push source code to the image registry,
the cluster must also have the proper credentials for being able to pull that
container image and unpack it so it can run tests, build the application, etc.

To do so, make sure the ServiceAccount used by the Workload points at the
Kubernetes secret that contains the credentials.

If the registry being targetted by the developer is the same as the one of whom
credentials are provided during the Workload namespace setup, no further action
is required here. Otherwise, follow the same steps as recommended for the
application image.


### How it works

When a Workload specifies that source code should come from an image (i.e.,
`workload.spec.source.image` is set pointing at the registry provided via
`--source-image`), instead of having a GitRepository object created, an
ImageRepository object is instantiated instead, with its spec filled in such a
way to keep track of images pushed the registry provided by the user.

For instance, given the following Workload

```yaml
apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: app
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: app
    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web
spec:
  source:
    image: 10.188.0.3:5000/test:latest
```

we see that instead of a GitRepository object, an ImageRepository is created:

```diff
  Workload/app
  │
- ├─GitRepository/app
+ ├─ImageRepository/app
  │
  ├─Image/app
  │ ├─Build/app-build-1
  │ │ └─Pod/app-build-1-build-pod
  │ ├─PersistentVolumeClaim/app-cache
  │ └─SourceResolver/app-source
  │
  ├─PodIntent/app
  │
  ├─ConfigMap/app
  │
  └─Runnable/app-config-writer
    └─TaskRun/app-config-writer-2zj7w
      └─Pod/app-config-writer-2zj7w-pod
```

This resource (`ImageRepository`) provides the same semantics as GitRepository,
except that it looks for source code in image registries rather than git
repositories.
